# Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

# Motivation

This framwork was created because most game engines are hard to get started with and they come in large file sizes, but also because we wanted to learn modern C++, and what better way to write hardcore C++ than within a game engine?

# Installation

Install these first:

nodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

CMake: https://cmake.org/download/

ez-gen: https://github.com/hamez0r/ez-gen


In terminal, go to ez-gen folder, and execute: npm install -g

Clone this repo:
https://github.com/radumotrescu/studious-engine

In terminal, go to studious-engine, and enter any of the folders starting with "ez-", then execute: ez-gen. This will generate a Visual Studio solution for you, where you can start making your game.


# API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

# Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

# License
